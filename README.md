# Welcome to DIGITAL-HODL-UP!

The purpose of the FOSE Foundation is to empower individuals and communities through free and open-source education. We aim to promote money literacy and other first-principles education by integrating game schooling techniques that make learning both engaging and accessible.

## Project Selection Criteria

### (1) PROOF-OF-WORK IMPACT

Hodl Up (the physcial game) has been played by thousands. Testimonies include Matt Odell (CD84), Preston Pysh (BTC140), Guy Swann (Chat103) and many, many plebs. For background on the company that made Hodl Up, Free Market Kids, visit https://www.freemarketkids.com

### (2) OPEN SOURCE LICENSING

Free Market Kids has granted FOSE Foundation use of the DIGITAL (not physical) Hodl Up game using license Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike (BY-NC-SA 4.0). See "License".  Free Market Kids retains the registered TM for Hodl Up and copyright for its rulebook and artwork.

### (3) PROOF-OF-CONCEPT

The front-end will be a progressive web app (PWA). The back-end will be Nostr. We have a single-player demonstration at https://hodlup.13prime.com

## Addressing Challenges

### (1) ﻿﻿﻿﻿AVAILABILITY

Physical games are expensive to produce and ship so their global impact is limited and slow. Digital versions eliminate these supply chain constraints.

### (2) ﻿﻿﻿﻿LANGUAGES 

Translating games to other languages faces minimum order quantity and other physical production realities. Digital versions are infinitely flexible.

### ﻿﻿﻿﻿(3) FREEDOM TECHNOLOGIES  

Physical games do not give users direct experience to Lightning or Nostr. Digital versions using Nostr on the backend provide a huge first step to introduce people to freedom technologies.
